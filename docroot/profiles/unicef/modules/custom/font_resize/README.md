# Font Resize
This module uses JQuery to resize the font size of your website.
For this to work properly, your theme needs to use relative font-size (em and rem)

## This module creates a sample block (Resize block) with 3 links.
A- - for reducing the font size
A - for resetting the font size
A+ - for increasing the font size

This block is configured to change the font size of the complete site.
You can place the block as per your site requirement.

##Creation of a block to changing font size for only a certain class/ id

* Create a new JS file - as a copy of js/example-font_resize.js
* Change html to <class/ id>
* Create a new block as a copy of the example block provided.
* Attach this new JS to the block 


This is a WIP module.
